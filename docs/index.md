PerfTools is an integration of Open Source performance tools that collect application performance data in high-performance computing environments.

PerfTools lays an emphasis on simple <em>command-line usage</em> with a consistent syntax. It favors saving output in <em>open human-friendly text</em>, as opposed to proprietary binary formats. It also ensures the performance tools run in aÂ  <em>text terminal</em> instead of requiring X Windows and fancy UIs.

You can [download perftools from GitHub](https://github.com/tushar-mohan/perftools).

You may also want to check out the [PerfBrowser Cloud Service](https://perfbrowser.perftools.org/), which allows you to visualize (in a browser) performance data collected by PerfTools.
