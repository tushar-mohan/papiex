[PerfTools](about) is an integration of complimentary Open Source performance tools that collect application performance data for high-performance computing linux clusters.

PerfTools consists of the following open source tools/libraries:

  * papiex, [papi](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/), libmonitor
  * [hpctoolkit](http://hpctoolkit.org)
  * ioex

PerfTools lays an emphasis on simple <em>command-line usage</em> with a consistent syntax. It favors saving output in <em>open human-friendly text</em>, as opposed to proprietary binary formats. It also ensures the performance tools run in aÂ  <em>text terminal</em> instead of requiring windowing environment.

[PerfTools is on GitHub](https://github.com/tushar-mohan/perftools).

You may also want to check out the [PerfBrowser Cloud](https://perfbrowser.perftools.org/), which allows you to visualize (in a browser) performance data collected by PerfTools. [pbctl](https://github.com/tushar-mohan/pbctl) is a command-line utility to upload collected performance data to the PerfBrowser Cloud.
