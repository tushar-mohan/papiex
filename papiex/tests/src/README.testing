To add a test case for a failed binary:

1. Add the <failed-test>.c file to papiex/tests/src

2. Edit papiex/tests/src/Makefile and add the <failed-test>.c
   to the SRCS variable.

3. Either add a clause for the test in some logical ng-driver like
   shell-ng.sh/syscalls-ng.sh or copy one of the *-ng.sh to 
   failed-test-ng.sh. Mke sure you have "-ng.sh" as the name of the 
   shell script. Then edit the file to suit your needs. Finally,
   edit papiex/tests/src/Makefile to add the driver script to
   the NG_TESTS variable (sans the .sh suffix)
